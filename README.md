# Foodles coding project frontend

## Installation

You need to have node installed to run this project.

- Run `$ yarn` to install dependencies
- Create a .env file at the root of the project and copy the content of .env.example into it
- Run `$ yarn start` to start the frontend

You can also run `$ yarn test` to run the tests

See `projectSummary.md` file for an explanation of my choices and assumptions, along with what I would have added with more time.
